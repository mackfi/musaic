This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Overview

This is a music web application loosely modeled after YouTube Music, which is my music app of choice for anyone who was curious.

Open https://musaic.online to view the current deployment.

## Notes

Currently, user authentication is most easily done through email, though GitHub should work as well. I would like to provide the user with more alternatives in the future.

I do not own the songs that are currently available on this website. If you enjoy any of these songs, please support the respective artists.
